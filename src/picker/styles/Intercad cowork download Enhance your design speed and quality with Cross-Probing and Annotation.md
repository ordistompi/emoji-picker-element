The user interface consists of four main parts: the menu bar, the toolbar, the session log, and the workspace. The menu bar contains commands for file operations, settings, help, and exit. The toolbar contains buttons for common functions such as opening or saving files, creating or joining sessions, checking or fixing errors, and generating reports. The session log shows the history of changes made by you or other designers in a session. The workspace shows the schematic or layout of your PCB design.
 
To use InterCAD CoWork, you need to create or join a session. A session is a collaborative workspace where you can share your PCB design with other designers and work on it together. To create a session, you need to click on the "Create Session" button on the toolbar and enter a session name and password. To join a session, you need to click on the "Join Session" button on the toolbar and enter the session name and password provided by the session creator.
 
Once you are in a session, you can open your PCB design file in OrCAD or PADS and start working on it. You can also invite other designers to join your session by sending them an email with the session name and password. You can see the changes made by other designers in real time in the session log and in your PCB design file. You can also communicate with other designers using the chat function in InterCAD CoWork.
 
InterCAD CoWork also provides a DRC function that checks your PCB design for errors and suggests fixes. You can access this function by clicking on the "Check Errors" button on the toolbar. You can see the list of errors in the session log and fix them by clicking on the "Fix Errors" button on the toolbar. You can also generate reports on your PCB design by clicking on the "Generate Report" button on the toolbar.
