Photoshop CC 2019 is the latest version of Adobe's flagship photo editing software, and it comes with some exciting new features and improvements. Whether you are a professional photographer, graphic designer, or hobbyist, you will find something to love in this update. Here are some of the highlights:
 
- **Content-Aware Fill**: This feature has been revamped to give you more control and flexibility over how Photoshop fills in the gaps when you remove unwanted objects from your images. You can now choose which source areas to use, preview the results, and output the fill to a new layer.
- **Blend Mode Preview**: No more guessing how different blend modes will affect your layers. You can now see a live preview of each blend mode by hovering over it in the Layers panel.
- **Color Wheel**: Photoshop now has a dedicated color wheel panel that lets you easily choose harmonious colors for your designs. You can also adjust the temperature, hue, saturation, and brightness of any color.
- **Frame Tool**: This new tool allows you to create placeholder frames for images. You can drag and drop images into the frames, and they will automatically scale and fit. You can also convert any shape or text layer into a frame.
- **Modern Undo**: Photoshop now has a more intuitive undo system that lets you use Ctrl+Z (Win) or Command+Z (Mac) to undo multiple steps, instead of toggling between undo and redo.
- **Symmetry Mode**: You can now create symmetrical paintings and drawings with the help of various symmetry presets. You can also create your own custom symmetry paths and use them with any brush tool.
- **And more**: Photoshop CC 2019 also includes improvements to the Select Subject command, the Export As dialog, the UI scaling, the performance, and more .

Photoshop CC 2019 is only available with a Creative Cloud subscription, which starts at $9.99 per month for the Photography plan that includes Lightroom as well[^1^]. If you want to try it out for free, you can download a 7-day trial from Adobe's website.
