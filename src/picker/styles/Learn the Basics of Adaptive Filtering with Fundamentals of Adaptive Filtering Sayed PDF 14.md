# Fundamentals of Adaptive Filtering by Ali H. Sayed: A Book Review
 
Adaptive filtering is a topic of immense practical and theoretical value, having applications in areas ranging from digital and wireless communications to biomedical systems. In this book, Ali H. Sayed, a professor of electrical engineering at UCLA and a Fellow of the IEEE, provides a comprehensive and rigorous treatment of the subject, covering both the fundamentals and the extensions of current theories.
 
The book consists of eleven parts, each part containing a series of focused lectures and ending with bibliographic comments, problems, and computer projects with MATLAB solutions. The book covers topics such as scalar-valued and vector-valued data, normal equations, orthogonality principle, linear models, constrained estimation, Kalman filter, steepest-descent technique, LMS algorithm, normalized LMS algorithm, affine projection algorithm, RLS algorithm, fast RLS algorithms, blind adaptive filtering, frequency-domain adaptive filtering, subband adaptive filtering, nonlinear adaptive filtering, and lattice filters.

Another strength of the book is its extensive coverage of the recent developments and extensions of adaptive filtering theory, such as blind adaptive filtering, frequency-domain adaptive filtering, subband adaptive filtering, nonlinear adaptive filtering, and lattice filters. The book also discusses some open problems and challenges in adaptive filtering research, such as robustness, stability, complexity, convergence, tracking, initialization, and regularization.
 
The book is well-written and well-organized, with a logical flow of topics and a smooth transition from one part to another. The book is also self-contained, with three introductory chapters on random variables, linear algebra, and complex gradients that provide the necessary background for the rest of the book. The book also includes an appendix on matrix calculus that summarizes some useful results and identities.
