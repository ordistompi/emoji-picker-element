## What is The Sims 3 Patch Update 1.0.631.00002 - Retail Version.rar.rar?
 
The Sims 3 Patch Update 1.0.631.00002 - Retail Version.rar.rar is a file name that some users may encounter when searching for a patch to update their game. However, this file name is misleading and incorrect, as it suggests that the patch is for version 1.0.631 only, and that it is compressed twice with the .rar extension. In fact, this file name refers to a patch that updates the game from version 1.0.631 to version 1.6.6[^1^], and it is only compressed once with the .rar extension.
 
## Why do I need to update The Sims 3 base game?
 
Updating The Sims 3 base game can improve your gaming experience by adding new features and fixing bugs and glitches. For example, the patch from version 1.0.631 to version 1.6.6 adds a new basement tool that allows you to build basements up to 4 levels deep under your lot[^1^]. It also fixes issues with save files, graphics, sound, gameplay, and more[^1^]. Updating the game can also make it compatible with newer expansion packs and custom content.
 
## How do I update The Sims 3 base game manually?
 
If you do not want to use the EA Download Manager or Origin to update your game automatically, you can update it manually by downloading and applying a standalone patch. However, you need to make sure that the patch matches your game region, otherwise you may get an error message saying that the installed game region for this update is incorrect[^2^]. To find out your game region, you can check the last number of your game version in the launcher or in the skuversion.txt file in your game folder[^2^]. The most common regions are:
 
- Region 1: USA
- Region 2: Worldwide (Europe/Australia/Rest of World)
- Region 3: Asia
- Region 5: Japan
- Region 7: Digital Download

Once you know your game region, you can download the appropriate patch from a reliable source, such as Mod DB or EA's official website[^1^] [^2^]. You can also use a cumulative super patcher that works for any region[^2^]. The file name should end with .exe and have a size of around 117 MB[^1^]. After downloading the patch, you can simply run it by double-clicking on it or right-clicking and selecting "Run as Administrator". Make sure that your game and launcher are not running before applying the patch.
 
## How do I verify that my game is updated?
 
After applying the patch, you can check your game version in the launcher or in the skuversion.txt file in your game folder. It should say "GameVersion = 1.6.6.002002" if your game is updated successfully[^1^]. You can also launch your game and see if the new features and bug fixes are working properly.
 
## Conclusion
 
Updating The Sims 3 base game manually can be done by downloading and applying a standalone patch that matches your game region or using a cumulative super patcher that works for any region. This can improve your gaming experience by adding new features and fixing bugs and glitches. However, you should always backup your save files and custom content before updating your game, in case something goes wrong or you want to revert to an older version.
