## The History and Legends of Tulja Bhavani Temple
 
Tulja Bhavani Temple is one of the oldest temples in Maharashtra. The temple has witnessed many rulers and their style of architecture, such as the Yadava Kingdom in the 13th Century with its Hemadpanti Style of Architecture, and the Maratha Kingdom in the late 17th and early 18th century with its Maratha style of Architecture. [^3^]
 
The temple is dedicated to Goddess Bhavani, who is a form of Goddess Parvati, the consort of Lord Shiva. She is also known as Tulaja, Turaja, Tvarita, Durga, Amba, Jagadamba and Ambika. She is worshipped as the patron deity of Maharashtra and Karnataka, and also by people of Telangana, Northern Karnataka, and Nepal. [^2^]
 
According to the legend, there was a sage named Kardam and his wife Anubhuti who lived near the Mandakini river. They had an infant son whom they loved dearly. After Kardam's death, Anubhuti performed a penance for Goddess Bhavani on the banks of the river to protect her son. A demon named Kukur harassed her and tried to kill her son. Goddess Bhavani appeared and killed the demon and rescued Anubhuti and her son. She also granted her a boon that she would reside on the hill of Balaghat as Tulja Bhavani and fulfill the wishes of her devotees. [^1^]
 
Another legend says that Goddess Sati, the first wife of Lord Shiva, immolated herself at her father Daksha's yagna when he insulted Shiva. Shiva became furious and carried her corpse on his shoulder and performed the Tandava dance, which threatened to destroy the universe. Lord Vishnu cut Sati's body into 51 pieces with his Sudarshana Chakra to calm down Shiva. The places where Sati's body parts fell are known as Shakti Peethas or seats of power. Tulja Bhavani Temple is one of them, where Sati's left arm is said to have fallen. [^1^]
 
## The Significance and Festivals of Tulja Bhavani Temple
 
Tulja Bhavani Temple is considered as one of the most sacred and powerful temples in India. It is believed that Goddess Bhavani grants boons to her devotees who worship her with faith and devotion. She is also revered as the goddess of power, justice, motherhood and emotions. She is the source of creative energy and the giver of life.
 
Many famous personalities have been associated with this temple, such as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the founder of the Maratha Empire, who was an ardent devotee of Tulja Bhavani. He visited this temple many times to seek her blessings and guidance. He also received a sword from her as a gift, which he named Bhavani Talwar. He used this sword to fight against the Mughals and establish Hindavi Swarajya or self-rule. [^4^]
 
The temple celebrates many festivals throughout the year, such as Navratri, Dussehra, Diwali, Makar Sankranti, Holi, Gudi Padwa and Chaitra Purnima. The most important festival is Navratri or nine nights of worshiping Goddess Durga in her nine forms. During this festival, thousands of devotees throng to the temple to offer prayers and perform rituals such as Kumari Puja (worshiping young girls), Durga Puja (worshiping idols), Kanya Puja (worshiping virgin girls) and Durga Havan (fire sacrifice). The temple is decorated with lights and flowers and various cultural programs are organized.
 
Another major festival is Chaitra Purnima or full moon day in the month of Chaitra (March-April). On this day, a grand procession or palanquin (Palkhi) of Goddess Bhavani is taken out from the temple to a nearby lake called Kallol Tirtha. The idol of Goddess Bhavani is bathed in the lake with holy water
