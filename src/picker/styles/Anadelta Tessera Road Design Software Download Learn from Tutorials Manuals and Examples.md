## How to Download Anadelta Tessera Road Design Software
 
Anadelta Tessera is available for Windows operating systems. You can download a free demo version from the official website[^1^]. The demo version has all the features of the full version, except that it does not allow you to save or print your projects. You can use the demo version for evaluation purposes for up to 30 days.
 
If you want to purchase the full version of Anadelta Tessera road design software, you can choose from different license options depending on your needs. You can buy a single-user license, a network license, or an academic license. You can also get an annual subscription that includes updates and technical support. You can check the price list[^1^] for more details.
 
Once you download the installation file, you can run it and follow the instructions on the screen. The installation process is simple and fast. You will need to enter your license key if you have purchased the full version. After the installation is complete, you can launch Anadelta Tessera from your desktop or start menu.
  
## How to Use Anadelta Tessera Road Design Software
 
Anadelta Tessera has a user-friendly interface that lets you access all the tools and functions easily. You can start a new project by selecting File > New Project from the menu bar. You will need to enter some basic information about your project, such as name, location, units, scale, etc. You can also import existing data from other sources, such as CAD files, GIS files, survey data, etc.
 
Anadelta Tessera has four main modules that cover different aspects of road design: horizontal alignment, vertical alignment, cross sections, and 3D model. You can switch between these modules by clicking on the tabs at the bottom of the screen. Each module has its own toolbar and properties panel that let you customize your design parameters and settings.
 
The horizontal alignment module allows you to define the geometry of your road using curves, spirals, clothoids, etc. You can also create intersections and interchanges automatically or manually. The vertical alignment module allows you to define the elevation profile of your road using grades, parabolas, circular arcs, etc. You can also check the drainage conditions and calculate the Bruckner diagram.
