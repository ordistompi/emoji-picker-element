Gastoldi was an Italian composer who lived from around 1554 to 1609. He is best known for his balletti, which are short and catchy songs with dance-like rhythms and simple harmonies. They were very popular in his time and influenced many composers after him, such as Thomas Morley and Michael Praetorius.
 
Il Ballerino, published in 1594, is one of his most famous works. It contains 20 balletti with Italian texts that describe various aspects of love, courtship, and social life. Some of them have humorous or satirical tones, such as "Il Contadino" (The Peasant), "Il Guerriero" (The Warrior), and "Il Cucu" (The Cuckoo). Others are more romantic or sentimental, such as "Amor Vittorioso" (Love Victorious), "Bella Gioiosa" (Beautiful Joyful), and "L'Innamorato" (The Lover).
 
The music of Il Ballerino is charming and expressive, with catchy melodies and lively rhythms. The three voices often imitate each other or sing in parallel thirds or sixths, creating a pleasant harmony. The lute accompaniment adds richness and variety to the texture. The songs are suitable for singing, playing, or dancing, as Gastoldi intended.

If you are curious about the history and context of Gastoldi's balletti, you might want to learn more about the genre and its origins. Balletti were a type of secular vocal music that emerged in Italy in the late 16th century. They were influenced by the madrigal, a more sophisticated and expressive form of polyphonic music that often used poetic texts. However, balletti were simpler and more accessible, with catchy tunes and dance-like rhythms. They also used more common and everyday language, sometimes with humorous or ironic effects.
 
Balletti were usually performed by three or four singers, accompanied by a lute or other plucked instruments. They were often sung or played at social gatherings, such as weddings, parties, or festivals. They were also used as entertainment or interludes in theatrical performances, such as comedies or pastoral plays. Some balletti even had choreographies or gestures that matched the music and the lyrics.
 
Gastoldi was one of the pioneers and masters of the genre. He published several collections of balletti for different combinations of voices and instruments. His balletti were widely admired and imitated by other composers, both in Italy and abroad. They also influenced the development of other musical forms, such as the English ballett, the German lied, and the French air de cour.
 
Gastoldi's balletti are not only musical gems from the Renaissance, but also valuable sources of information about the society and culture of his time. They reflect the tastes, values, and attitudes of the people who sang, played, or listened to them. They also reveal the diversity and richness of the Italian language and literature of that period.
