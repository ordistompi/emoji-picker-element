Purge is a novel by Finnish-Estonian writer Sofi Oksanen, first published in 2008. It tells the story of two women, Aliide and Zara, who are connected by a dark family history that spans decades and countries. The novel explores themes of trauma, violence, identity, and memory, as well as the political and social upheavals that shaped Estonia's history in the 20th century.
 
The novel begins in 1992, when Aliide, an elderly woman living alone in a rural farmhouse, finds a young woman hiding in her yard. The woman, Zara, is a sex trafficking victim who has escaped from her captors in Tallinn. Aliide reluctantly takes her in, but soon realizes that Zara is not a stranger. She is the granddaughter of her sister Ingel, who disappeared during the Soviet occupation of Estonia. Aliide has a secret of her own: she was involved in the betrayal and murder of her sister's husband Hans, a resistance fighter who was Aliide's true love. As the two women bond over their shared pain and guilt, they also face the threat of Zara's pursuers, who are looking for her and the valuable documents she stole from them.
