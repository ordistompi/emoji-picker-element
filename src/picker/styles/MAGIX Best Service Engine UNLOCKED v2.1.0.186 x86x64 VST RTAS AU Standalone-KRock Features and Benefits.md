This software is a fully customizable multi-page sample player that was developed in cooperation by Magix (former Yellow Tools) and Best Service and is based on the Independence Sampler Technology. It can load and use an unlimited number of instruments in seconds, thanks to its ultra fast streaming integration, multi core processor support and the Auto-RAM-Cleaner feature.
 
It also offers hundreds of music related features, such as a user-friendly interface, file management, surround sound support up to 8.1, legato, convolution reverb, midi processing and more. It is designed to offer creative, flexible and immediate solutions for music producers, film-composers, sound designers, songwriters and re-mixers.
 
One of the best things about this software is that it is unlocked for YellowTools/BestService (E-Licensor protected) & MAGIX Independence (Vita/Protein protected) libraries & also some old YellowTools (WibuKey protected) libraries. This means that you can use it to expand your Independence library or use any of the Engine-based products that are fully compatible with it.
 
Some of the Engine-based products include Ethno World 6 Complete, Klanghaus 2, Forest Kingdom II, Era II Medieval Legends and more. You can find a full list of compatible products on the Best Service website[^1^].
 
Another great thing about this software is that it supports 64-bit OS X 10.6, 10.7, 10.8 and higher. This means that you can take full advantage of your computer's RAM and load as many instruments as you like (and your computer can handle). You can also use it as a standalone application or as a plugin in your favorite sequencer, such as Cubase, Logic, Pro Tools or Ableton Live.
 
If you want to learn how to use this software, you can check out the user manual that comes with it or watch some video tutorials on YouTube[^2^]. You can also visit the official forum[^3^] to get help from other users or share your feedback and suggestions.
