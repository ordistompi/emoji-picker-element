## Episode 1: The Beginning of Everything
 
The episode begins with a flashback to eight years ago, when Yoo Si-jin (Song Joong-ki), a young soldier, meets Kang Mo-yeon (Song Hye-kyo), a medical student, at a hospital. They have a brief encounter that leaves an impression on both of them. However, they do not exchange contact information and go their separate ways.
 
In the present day, Yoo Si-jin is now a captain of the special forces unit known as Alpha Team. He and his best friend and fellow soldier Seo Dae-young (Jin Goo) are assigned to a covert mission in Afghanistan. On their way there, they encounter a group of armed thieves who have stolen a truck full of medical supplies. They manage to stop them and recover the truck, but they also discover that one of the thieves is injured and needs medical attention.
 
Meanwhile, Kang Mo-yeon is now a successful doctor and an instructor at Haesung Hospital. She is ambitious and confident, but she also faces discrimination and corruption in her workplace. She is frustrated by her lack of recognition and promotion despite her hard work and skills. She also has a crush on Han Suk-won (Tae In-ho), the director of the hospital, who seems to be interested in her as well.
 
Yoo Si-jin and Kang Mo-yeon meet again when he brings the injured thief to Haesung Hospital. They recognize each other from their previous encounter and feel an attraction. However, they also clash over their different views on life and death. Yoo Si-jin believes that he has to kill to protect lives, while Kang Mo-yeon believes that she has to save lives no matter what. They also have trouble communicating due to their busy schedules and different priorities.
