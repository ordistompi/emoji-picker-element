Fundamentals of Modern VLSI Devices is a comprehensive textbook that covers the basic properties and designs of modern very-large-scale integration (VLSI) devices, as well as the factors affecting their performance. The book is written by Yuan Taur, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, San Diego, and Tak H. Ning, an IBM Fellow at the T.J. Watson Research Center, New York. The book has been widely adopted as a standard textbook in microelectronics in many major universities and worldwide.

The book provides an in-depth discussion of device scaling and scaling limits of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) and bipolar devices, as well as the latest developments in high-k gate dielectrics, metal gate technology, strained silicon mobility, non-gradual channel approximation (GCA), silicon-on-insulator (SOI) devices, and advanced devices of future potential. The book also includes two new chapters on read and write operations of commonly used static random-access memory (SRAM), dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), and non-volatile memory arrays. The book contains 18 appendices that cover various topics such as spatial variation of quasi-Fermi potentials, image-force-induced barrier lowering, and power gain of a two-port network. The book also provides homework exercises at the end of every chapter to test the students' understanding and engage them with real-world problems.
 
The solution manual for Fundamentals of Modern VLSI Devices provides detailed solutions to all the problems in the textbook. The solutions are checked against the reality of silicon data and are consistent with the equations and parameters provided in the book. The solution manual is an invaluable resource for students and instructors who want to master the concepts and applications of modern VLSI devices.
  
The book is divided into three parts. Part I covers the basic properties of MOSFETs and bipolar transistors, such as current-voltage characteristics, threshold voltage, subthreshold slope, channel length modulation, drain-induced barrier lowering, short-channel effects, mobility degradation, velocity saturation, output resistance, transconductance, intrinsic gain, and parasitic capacitances. Part I also introduces the MOSFET scale length theory and the high-field transport models that are essential for understanding device scaling and performance.
 
Part II focuses on the device scaling and scaling limits of CMOS and bipolar devices. It discusses the scaling principles and methods, such as constant-field scaling, constant-voltage scaling, generalized scaling, and power-delay product scaling. It also analyzes the scaling limits imposed by various physical phenomena, such as quantum-mechanical effects, tunneling effects, hot-carrier effects, punchthrough effects, breakdown effects, thermal effects, noise effects, and reliability issues. Part II also presents the latest technologies that overcome some of the scaling limits, such as high-k gate dielectrics, metal gate electrodes, strained silicon channels, non-GCA models, and SOI devices.
 
Part III covers the read and write operations of SRAM, DRAM, and non-volatile memory arrays. It explains the basic structures and principles of these memory devices, as well as the factors that affect their performance and reliability. It also discusses the design tradeoffs and optimization techniques for these memory devices. Part III also introduces some advanced memory devices that have potential for future applications, such as ferroelectric random-access memory (FeRAM), magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM), phase-change random-access memory (PCRAM), and resistive random-access memory (RRAM).
