Propellerhead ReCycle 2.2 is a creative tool that helps you make the most of your grooves. In simple terms, ReCycle lets you do with sampled loops what you can do with beats programmed from individual drum sounds â like alter the tempo, or replace sounds and process them individually. A tool for quickly editing sampled parts, chopping up riffs, remixing and doing mash ups.

## Step 2: Load a Loop or Sample
 
To create a REX2 file, you need to load a loop or sample into ReCycle 2.2. You can do this by clicking on the "Open" button on the toolbar or by dragging and dropping a file from your computer onto the waveform display.
 
ReCycle 2.2 supports various audio formats, such as WAV, AIFF, MP3, OGG, etc. You can also load files from CDs or DVDs by using the "Import Audio CD" option from the "File" menu.
 
Once you have loaded a loop or sample into ReCycle 2.2, it will automatically analyze it and detect its tempo and slice points. You should see something like this:
