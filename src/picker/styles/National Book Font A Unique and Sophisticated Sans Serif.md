National Book Font has a deceptively simple appearance, with subtle details that give it a distinctive but not distracting personality. It was drawn as a stylistic opposite to Helvetica, with looser spacing, unambiguous forms, old-style figures and a "true" italic. The general functional aim is a typeface that can be used for long-form reading at small sizes, as well as for display purposes.
 
National Book Font is available for purchase and download from Klim Type Foundry's website[^2^]. However, some websites offer free downloads of National Book Font or similar fonts, such as Getty Fonts[^1^]. These websites may not have the permission or license to distribute the font, and may also contain malware or viruses. Therefore, it is recommended to download fonts only from trusted sources and to scan them before installation.

If you want to use National Book Font in your website, you have two options: either purchase a web font license from Klim Type Foundry[^2^], or use a similar free font that is available for web use.
