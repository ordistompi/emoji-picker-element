# How to Download IEEE 1584-2018 Standard for Free
 
IEEE 1584-2018 is a guide for performing arc-flash hazard calculations. It provides mathematical models for designers and facility operators to apply in determining the arc-flash hazard distance and the incident energy to which workers could be exposed during their work on or near electrical equipment. It covers applications for three-phase alternating current (AC) voltages from 208 V to 15 kV.

If you are looking for a way to download IEEE 1584-2018 standard for free, you may be disappointed to know that it is not available for free online. IEEE standards are copyrighted and require a purchase or a subscription to access them. However, there are some ways you can get access to IEEE 1584-2018 standard without paying a full price.
 
## Option 1: Join IEEE or an IEEE Society
 
One way to get access to IEEE 1584-2018 standard is to join IEEE or one of its societies. IEEE members get discounts on IEEE standards purchases and subscriptions. For example, if you join the IEEE Industry Applications Society (IAS), which sponsors the IEEE 1584-2018 standard, you can get access to the IAS Standards Library, which includes over 200 IAS standards, including IEEE 1584-2018. The annual membership fee for IAS is $35 for professionals and $18 for students. You can also join other IEEE societies that are relevant to your field of interest and get access to their standards libraries.
 
## Option 2: Use Your Institution's Subscription
 
Another way to get access to IEEE 1584-2018 standard is to use your institution's subscription. Many academic institutions, research organizations, and companies have subscriptions to IEEE Xplore, which is a digital library that provides access to over 5 million documents, including IEEE standards. If your institution has a subscription to IEEE Xplore, you can use your institution's credentials to log in and download IEEE 1584-2018 standard for free. You can check if your institution has a subscription by visiting [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplorehelp/#/access/my-subscription](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplorehelp/#/access/my-subscription).
 
## Option 3: Request a Free Trial or a Quote
 
A third way to get access to IEEE 1584-2018 standard is to request a free trial or a quote from IEEE. IEEE offers free trials and quotes for individuals and organizations who are interested in purchasing or subscribing to IEEE standards. You can request a free trial or a quote by visiting [https://standards.ieee.org/contact-us.html](https://standards.ieee.org/contact-us.html) and filling out the form with your information and needs. You may be able to get a limited-time access or a discounted price for IEEE 1584-2018 standard.
