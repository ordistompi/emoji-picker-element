If you are looking for a realistic and in-depth simulation of a modern fighter aircraft, you might want to check out the Bear Studios Su-30MK/MKK Strike Flanker.

The Su-30 is a multi-role fighter for all-weather, air-to-air and air-to-surface deep interdiction missions, generally similar to the US F-15E Strike Eagle. It has two distinct version branches, manufactured by KnAAPO and the Irkut Corporation, both of which come under the Sukhoi group's umbrella. KnAAPO manufactures the Su-30MKK and the Su-30MK2, which are mainly exported to China and other Asian countries. The Chinese chose an older but lighter radar so the canards could be omitted in return for increased payload. Irkut offered the multirole Su-30MK/MKI for the Indian Air Force, along with its ground-attack capabilities. The series adds features for the air-superiority role, such as canards, thrust-vectoring and a long-range phase-array radar. The Russian Air force operates several Su-30s and has ordered the Su-30SM version.
  
The Bear Studios Su-30MK/MKK Strike Flanker features a highly detailed external model with animated weapons delivery and jettison sequence. The weapons and storages are individually modeled with weight, and the storage management system detects their status and takes dynamic changes. The virtual cockpit is also highly detailed, with high resolution textures, emissive avionics, MFD and HUD, flood light and console light in two colors, switchable cockpit positions and more. The product also simulates the N-001VE multi-role fire control radar and electrical optical sensor system, which has five main modes for searching, detecting and calculating fire control solutions to designated AI or fixed ground targets. The radar has six different scan sub modes related to proper weapons or working functions. The product also features a custom auto throttle for cruise, approach and takeoff status, which is continually adjusted by the flight control system. The product also allows you to perform over stall maneuvers such as cobra, vertical wheel and other super maneuvers that can be done on flanker aircrafts.
